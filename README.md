# Movies
A movie database project showcasing modern React development, architectural patterns, and backend integration.



## Overview
This repository documents my journey of learning and applying React best practices, routing, state management and backend connectivity.  
It serves as both a reference and a portfolio of implemented features, with a focus on clean, scalable architecture.



## Key Concepts Learned
- **React Routers**
  - Implemented client-side navigation using `react-router-dom`.
  - Dynamic routing with URL parameters.
  - Nested routes and layout components.

- **Component Architecture**
  - Separation of **UI**, **Pages**, **Containers**, and **Atoms** for maintainability.
  - Reusable components with clear responsibilities.

- **Custom Hooks**
  - Created reusable logic for fetching data, handling forms, and state persistence.
  - Leveraged hooks to keep components clean and focused on presentation.

- **State Management**
  - Utilized Reactâ€™s built-in `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

- **Server and Database Integration**
  - Connect to a backend PostgreSQL database via Node.js/Express using Render's servers.
    - using `fetch` for TMDB API calls and `axios` for the Node server calls for educational purposes
  - Use a local Postgres instance in a Docker container for testing.
  - Learn how to handle CRUD operations and REST API integration.



## Planned Features
- **Authentication**
  - Implement secure login/logout and session handling.

- **Deployment**
  - Deploy to a live environment (GitHub Pages / Vercel) with CI/CD setup.



## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (Planned):** Node.js, Express
- **Database (Planned):** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub (SSH setup)
